Working Prototype Known Problems Report
2do2

Known bugs:
- Attempting to create an account and failing, then attempting to login does not work without manually navigating to /login
- Add and update form's autoload with previous form entries instead of the info of the item you are editing
- Create account form collapses on failed attempt
- Favacon image (tab icon) does not load)
- Deleting last task in an account can rarely block add form from working (seems to be chain of events?)
- Dragging to re-order does not save in new order
- Update cannot nullify a field

Acceptance testing user stories:
As a user I want to be able to
- create an account
- log out of my account
- log into my account
- add tasks and subtasks
- edit tasks
- view subtasks
- delete subtasks
- sort tasks by date
